Wanted to analyze the results of a Soccer League and to find any circular result.
For example, if A 3-2 B, B 3-1 C, C 1-0 D, D 2-1 A, then we can say there is a circle of results.
    
A fun project, probably no real significance.

However, the process resulted in a lot of data mining.
Ended up writing a script that fetched match results and score lines for each 
season of top five leagues in Europe, over 400 seasons.
Parsed, extracted and cleaned the dat; and stored in a csv format.

With the cleaned data, some interesting analyses and visuals could be made.
That was the next step I planned, but never actually got it done.

The extracted data is still here, so I may come back to it at some point.

Done back in 2016.
